# Fake News Predictor

This is a small web application for analysing news articles written in Romanian
(mainly those about the COVIDâ€‘19 pandemic), in an attempt to detect fake news.

The application is written using Flask. Predictions are made by a Python model
available on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/pandrei7/fakenews-mtl).

> **Disclaimer**: The predictions made by the application do not constitute
objective facts and do not reflect my opinion.

## Running the application

Before you follow these steps, make sure you have Python 3 installed. Also, keep
in mind that the model is quite large and might require **around 2GB of storage
space** and RAM.

First, clone this repository to a directory and `cd` into it.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pandrei7/fake-news-app.git
cd fake-news-app
```

Before running the application, you need to download some Python dependencies.
You can do this using `pip`. Optionally, you might want to use a virtual
environment to prevent problems with different library versions.

```bash
# (Optional) Create a virtual environment and activate it.
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate       # If using bash.
source venv/bin/activate.fish  # If using fish.

# Install the dependencies.
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Now you should be able to run the application. The model should get downloaded
automatically the first time you run.

```bash
python3 main.py
```

Open your browser and access `localhost:8080`.
